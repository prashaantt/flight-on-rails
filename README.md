# About

A sample calendar app running on Rails backend with [Flight](http://flightjs.github.io) on the frontend.

Contains calendar renderer code taken in great part from https://github.com/ccallebs/HTML5-Canvas-Calendar converted to a Flight mixin and adapted for RaphaelJS.

# Setup

- bundle install
- bower install
- rails s

# Issues

- Intends to use Mongoid, but no persistence implementation done yet.
- Chrome only. The Calendar renderer currently has issues running in other browsers.

# Credits
